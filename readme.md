# Go Team Ponies!
We are a team destined for greatness. Or pizza. One of the two.

+ Max Fox (What does the fox say?)
+ Ken (What _does_ he say?
+ Mohsin (Nothing. He says nothing.)
+ Josh Wilson (How should I know?) 
+ Mark L ([Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!](http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-fox-lyrics-ylvis.html))

Some thoughts/App Ideas
